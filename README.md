# About the Project
## Inspiration
When someone gets sick or injured, they’re often overwhelmed — especially students, low-income families, and people unfamiliar with the healthcare system. They’re forced to answer multiple stressful questions at once:
Where should I go? Is this serious? Will my insurance cover it? How much will it cost?
Many end up delaying care, visiting out-of-network facilities, or paying huge unexpected bills.
We built Care Compass to eliminate this confusion — to become a trusted, AI-powered guide that helps anyone, regardless of background or income, navigate healthcare with confidence and clarity.

## What it does?
Care Compass takes user input — including symptoms, medical history, location, and insurance plan — and intelligently matches them to the best available, in-network healthcare options.
It provides:
A clear triage recommendation (e.g., ER, Urgent Care, or wait for doctor).
A ranked list of covered hospitals or clinics, including estimated co-pay, wait time, and distance.
First-aid suggestions for immediate safety.
All presented in a single, simple, empathetic interface.
In short, Care Compass helps users make the right decision, at the right place, for the right price.

## How we built it?
Frontend: Built using Streamlit, providing a clean, web-based interface that allows users to easily input symptoms, location, and insurance details.
Backend: Powered by the Gemini API, with integrations from OpenStreetMap, MedGemma, and Hugging Face to process healthcare data, map locations, and enhance natural language understanding.
AI Layer: Utilizes Gemini API for intelligent symptom interpretation, insurance matching, and real-time recommendation generation.
UI Design: Focused on accessibility, empathy, and simplicity, ensuring users can make confident care decisions quickly — even in stressful situations.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating insurance network data across multiple providers proved complex due to inconsistent formats.
Designing a clear and non-technical UI that feels comforting during a stressful health event.
Ensuring privacy and security when handling sensitive health and insurance information.
Balancing AI recommendations with real-world medical reliability.
Biggest challenege was using the free gemini API and using up the rate limit, which meant it could not fetch the queries.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Built a fully functional prototype that connects symptom input to real hospital and insurance data.
Created an empathetic AI interface that communicates in a calm, human-centered tone.
Developed a solution that truly serves vulnerable users — especially students and lower-income groups who often struggle most with healthcare navigation.

## What we learned?
Healthcare access is as much about clarity and confidence as it is about coverage.
Empathy-driven design can transform how people interact with health technology.
Building a bridge between insurance data, medical logic, and user emotion is complex but deeply impactful.
Collaboration between AI, healthcare, and UX design is essential to solve real-world problems.

## What's next for Care Compass?
We’re expanding Care Compass to:
Integrate real-time insurance verification and appointment booking.
Offer personalized preventive care suggestions based on medical history.
Partner with universities, community clinics, and insurers to make the tool widely accessible to students and underserved communities.
Develop a mobile app for instant access anytime, anywhere.
Our mission is to ensure no one — student, parent, or patient — ever feels lost when it comes to their care.

# How to Run This Project?

Clone the Repository

git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [your-repo-name]


Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Secret Keys

Create a file at .streamlit/secrets.toml.

Add your Gemini API key (from Google AI Studio):

GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIza..."


Run the Triage API 

Open the Triage_model.py notebook in Google Colab.

Set the Colab Secrets: Add your HF_TOKEN (Hugging Face) and NGROK_TOKEN (ngrok) to the Colab secrets panel (🔑 icon).

Run the notebook: Run both cells. At the end, it will print a public ngrok URL:
--- Your Triage API is LIVE at: https://your-unique-url.ngrok-free.dev ---

Run the Main App 

Update the URL: Open app.py and paste the ngrok URL from colab into the TRIAGE_API_URL variable.

Important: This project has two parts that must run at the same time. You must keep the Colab notebook (from Step 4) running in one browser tab. This is your "Triage Server." The app.py script (your Streamlit app) is the "Frontend" that calls that server.

Run Streamlit: In your terminal, run:

streamlit run app.py
